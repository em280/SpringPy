# Web-Scraping and Cloud SQL 

*Emmanuel Molefi, 2023*

The notenook provides code to explore web-scraping and persisting data to Cloud SQL (https://cloud.google.com/sql), a cloud-based databased by Google Cloud (https://cloud.google.com). The code is deliberately trivial in order to focus only on the core procedures that would be key to establishing a connection to the cloud database and persisting data then fetching the data back again.
